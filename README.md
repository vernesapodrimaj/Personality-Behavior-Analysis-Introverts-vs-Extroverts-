This project explores how **introverts** and **extroverts** differ in behavior across various real-world and online settings. It also defines and identifies a third group—**ambiverts**—based on behavioral balance.

The project includes:

- Data cleaning and analysis in **Python**
- Behavioral trait comparison across personality types
- Rule-based classification of **ambiverts**
- An **interactive dashboard** using **Looker Studio**
- A clean **GitHub repository** with code and visuals


## ✅ Objectives

- Clean and explore a real-world personality dataset  
- Compare introverts vs extroverts across behavioral metrics  
- Define **ambiverts** using a custom rule  
- Visualize insights using Python and Looker Studio  
- Share findings in a portfolio-ready format

## 🧰 Tools Used

- `pandas` – data manipulation  
- `seaborn` & `matplotlib` – visualization  
- `Looker Studio` – dashboard for stakeholder presentation  
- `Jupyter Notebook` – analysis & documentation
